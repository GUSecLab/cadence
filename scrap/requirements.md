* Mobility data sets as input
  *  contract trace from input

* Mobile data set exports
  * dat format for use in physical phone simulations

* Extensible node state
  *  object model for nodes that mimics local storage and state

* Extensible handoff routines
  * builtin: fload(perc, t/o) => ideal path
  * builtin: random walk (perc, t/o)
  * algorithmic API
  
* Parallization
  * running mult. algs in parallel (why we want to sue go)
